.SH NAME
dm \- X display manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
dm \fIconfigfile logintty\fR [-noconsole] \fIconsoletty\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fIDm\fR is intended to be run by \fIinit\fR to startup the X server,
the X console, and X login.  It will read out of the specified config
file the command lines for these three processes.  
.PP
This file consists of lines containing the program name, whitespace,
and the commandline for the program.  The program names recognized are
\fBdm\fB, \fBX\fR, \fBconsole\fR, \fBlogin\fR, and \fBttylogin\fR.
Everything from a hash mark to the end-of-line will be ignored as a
comment.  \fIDm\fR recognizes one command line option from this file,
-display. If it is not specified, \fIdm\fR will default to :0.
.PP
The X server will be started first, using the SIGUSR1 handshake
present in X11R4.  \fIDm\fR will keep a connection open to prevent the
X server from inadvertently resetting should the user at some point
have closed all X connections temporarily.  Next the console will be
started, reading from the master side of the pseudo-tty specified as
the \fIlogintty\fR.  If \fIlogintty\fR is already in use, another
pseudo-tty will be chosen.  Then the login will be started, with stdin
set to \fI/dev/null\fR and stdout and stderr set to \fIlogintty\fR.
The display manager then waits for a change in the status of its
children or a signal to arrive.  If the display manager encounters
errors while starting up, it will initiate a console login.
.PP
If the console exits, another one will be started.  If the X server or
xlogin exit, the display manager will clean up and exit.  This
includes a call to \fIal_acct_revert(3)\fR to clean up the user's login
session if necessary.  If xlogin exits with status 2, it is requesting
that a raw console login be started.  If the display manager receives
SIGFPE, it will kill its children and sleep forever (this is a way to
shutdown the display during updates).
.PP
If the \fB-noconsole\fR switch is given, it will not redirect system
console output to the console process.  This is necessary if more than
one display manager is running on a machine.

.SH BUGS
Sometimes the console does not revert back to the real console when a
console login is requested.

Sometimes it is necessary to press SHIFT, CONTROL, and/or META before
keys work normally when a console login is requested.
