.SH DESCRIPTION
This program allows the user to manipulate the console window.  If
invoked as \fBconfig_console\fR or given the \fB-config\fR argument,
it will reconfigure the console.  This causes the console to re-read
its resources, re-grab the logical console for the workstation, and
hide itself.  To change the default behavior of the console, load your
console resources into the X server with ``xrdb -merge
\fIfilename\fR'', then invoke \fIconfig_console\fR.  See console(8)
for a list of resources that are honored.

If the program is called \fBhide_console\fR or it is invoked with the
\fB-hide\fR argument, instead of reconfiguring the console it will
make the window disappear until the next time it has something to
display.

If the program is called \fBshow_console\fR or it is invoked with the
\fB-show\fR argument, instead of reconfiguring the console it will
make the window reappear on the screen.
